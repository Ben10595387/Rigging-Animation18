Connection Editor 
	Select objects-Reload left, Reload Right
	Select one object in the editor, 
	Left/ Right display-useful
	Options-alphabetical order 
	Great for switches
	
	Hook up translation of one object to translation of other object. 
Node editor
	pretty self explanitory
	Does not maintain offset
	Can be used for tires. 
	Transform - Position info, (Null object) 
	Shape node - collection of vertecies.These two are not connected. 
	Don't worry about unit conversion nodes

Broken FK (IK, FK switch)
	Create groups, skeleton, fk/ ik rigs, controls. 
	Hierarchy vs Constraints - Constraints win. 
	Inputs tab on Channel - Can be used for props.
	In game- Jnts have to be in Hierarchy

	Cool Stuff
	Parent Translation, not rotation. How do you code this? _Game controller 
	Add attribute- follow translate, follow rotate. Set values.
	Connection editor, or node editor. 
		- load in constrainer and constraineee
		- follow translate connection
		- follow rotate connection. 
		- Connect follow translate to translate and follow to ect. 
	In Node editor 
		- from outliner middle click and drag to node ed. 
		- Drag from constraint to target - rotation or translation. 
Space Switches
	IK use 
	select IK handle, may want it to follow something and not have to move it. 
	world transform, COG, limb switches(greatest affect on limb jnt). 
	Go big to small. 
	Parent Constrain Ctrl to world transform, then to others. 
	Add atribute - follow 
		Enum- World, ect. This feeds the key, so you don't need to add 5 attributes.
	Set driven key
		need 4 sets of keys
		Can select all of targets. 
		Select correct enum, all 0 exept for ctrl that you want to take over. 
		Open up graph editor, make keys straight, not curved.
