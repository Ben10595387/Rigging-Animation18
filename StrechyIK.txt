Create standard IK rig.
Node Editor
Create 3 Multiply/Devide Nodes for shoulder, elbow, and wrist values. 
	Copy X values from joints and past them in the IX on the MD node.
Create PlusMinusAverage node.
	Output from shoulder X MD node to ID[0] 
	Output from Elbow X MD node to ID[1]
	Ect. 
	Channel box- edit change precision 6 # after decimals 
Create 2 locators to measure distance. Grp them. 
	Point Ctraint from Ctrl not jnt. 
Create a Distance Between node. 
	Use Locator's SHAPE node, not transform. Connect W.P to Point 1 in D.B. node.
	Connect W.P. of Locator's shape node to Point 2 in D.B.
Create M.D. node. 
	Output 1D into 2x on M.D. and Distance output to input 1X

Create 2 M.D. Nodes - see image
Some science stuff
Create blendColors1
	outColorR from Conditional node to color R on BC
IK control to Blender of BC. do this for both Joints. 

Take Length01 (added attribute) to shoulder MD 2x
	Same for other Length02 

Global scale
	add attribute on Transform Ctrl.
	Att global scale 
	Channel ed
	Global scale attribute on Transform Ctrl to Scale XYZ of Main Group.
	new M.D. node. Global scale from Transfrom Ctrl to Input 2 of M.D. node.
	plug in length from PMA to new MD input 1, put in output of MD to input 2 of 
	scalar MD node.    
Display-connection style for connection line appearance.
