Create standard IK rig.
Node Editor
Create 3 Multiply/Devide Nodes for shoulder, elbow, and wrist values. 
	Copy X values from joints and past them in the IX on the MD node.
4Create PlusMinusAverage node.
	Output from shoulder X MD node to ID[0] 
	Output from Elbow X MD node to ID[1]
	Ect. 
	Channel box- edit change precision 6 # after decimals 
1Create 2 locators to measure distance. Grp them. 
	Point Ctraint from Ctrl not jnt. 
2Create a Distance Between node. 
	Use Locator's SHAPE node, not transform. Connect W.P to Point 1 in D.B. node.
	Connect W.P. of Locator's shape node to Point 2 in D.B.
3Create M.D. node. 
	Output 1D into 2x on M.D. and Distance output to input 1X
5Create Condition node
	1term-distance from distance node
	2nd term output 1d from length plus minus average node.
	3rd term output x from scalar md to color if true conditional. 

6Create Blender Node 
	out colorR of Condition node to Color 1
	in channel editor change color 2r to one. 
7Add float attribute on IK handle
	take attribute to blender att of blend node
8Create 2 md nodes
	take output X of length node to input 1X of respective joint MD.
	Multiply BC node output 1R to 2X Channel on bothMD nodes.
9Connect MD output of x to translate X of Respective Jnts. 

IK control to Blender of BC. do this for both Joints. 

Take Length01 (added attribute) to shoulder MD 2x
	Same for other Length02 

Global scale
	add attribute on Transform Ctrl.
		Att global scale Min 0 Max 1 
	Channel ed change precision to 6. 
	Global scale attribute on Transform Ctrl to Scale XYZ of Main Group.
	new M.D. node. Global scale from Transfrom Ctrl to Input 2 of M.D. node.
	plug in length from PMA to new MD input 1, put in output of MD to input 2 of 
	scalar MD node.    
Display-connection style for connection line appearance.
